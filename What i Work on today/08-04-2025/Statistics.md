## **1. Foundations of Statistics for Data Science**  
- Basic concepts: Population, sample, variables (categorical/numerical)  
- Probability essentials: Rules, distributions (normal, binomial, Poisson)  
- Descriptive statistics: Measures of central tendency, dispersion, and shape (skewness/kurtosis)  

## **2. Data Handling and Preprocessing**  
- Data collection and sampling techniques  
- Data cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and duplicates  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Summary statistics and data visualization (histograms, box plots, heatmaps)  

## **3. Statistical Inference**  
- Hypothesis testing: t-tests, chi-square tests, p-values, and confidence intervals  
- Bayesian vs. frequentist inference  
- Central Limit Theorem (CLT) and its role in sampling  

## **4. Predictive Modeling and Machine Learning**  
- Regression analysis: Linear, logistic, and polynomial regression  
- Classification techniques: Decision trees, random forests, and SVMs  
- Model evaluation: Metrics (RMSE, accuracy, AUC-ROC), cross-validation, and regularization (Lasso/Ridge)  

## **5. Advanced Statistical Methods**  
- Time series analysis: ARIMA, forecasting  
- Clustering: K-means, hierarchical clustering  
- Dimensionality reduction: PCA, t-SNE  

## **6. Big Data and Modern Tools**  
- Statistical computing with Python (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn) and R  
- Big data frameworks: Spark, Hadoop  
- A/B testing and experimental design  

## **7. Ethics and Applications**  
- Ethical considerations: Bias, fairness, and privacy (GDPR)  
- Case studies: Real-world applications in finance, healthcare, and marketing
