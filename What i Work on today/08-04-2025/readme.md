### **Key Theoretical Concepts**  
1. **Descriptive vs. Inferential Statistics**  
   - Descriptive statistics summarize data (e.g., mean, graphs) .  
   - Inferential statistics make predictions/generalizations (e.g., hypothesis testing) .  

2. **Probability Foundations**  
   - Probability underpins inferential methods, enabling predictions about populations from samples .  

3. **Central Limit Theorem**  
   - The distribution of sample means approximates a normal distribution, critical for hypothesis testing .  

4. **Hypothesis Testing**  
   - A structured process to evaluate claims about populations using sample data .  

5. **Regression Analysis**  
   - Models relationships between variables, emphasizing prediction and causation .

### **Curriculum Gaps and Enhancements**  
- Modern curricula emphasize **data ethics** and **practical study design** .  
- Integration of technology (e.g., statistical software) is often missing but recommended .
